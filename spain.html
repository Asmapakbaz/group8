          Spain is a country located in Southwestern Europe, with parts of its
          territory in the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean
          Sea.[11][g] The largest part of Spain is situated on the Iberian
          Peninsula; its territory also includes the Canary Islands in the
          Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, and the
          autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla in Africa. The country's
          mainland is bordered to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of
          Biscay; to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea and Gibraltar;
          and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the largest
          country in Southern Europe and the second-largest and fourth-most
          populous in the European Union. Spain's capital and largest city is
          Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Zaragoza,
          Seville, MÃ¡laga, Murcia, Palma de Mallorca, Las Palmas de Gran
          Canaria, and Bilbao.
